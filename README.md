# CP1404 Practicals

Practical work for IT@JCU CP1404

## About the Subject

In this subject, I'm learning the basics of computer programming and building my coding skills using Python. 
I’m getting hands-on experience with important software development practices like version control, testing, and debugging.

## About Me

Hi! My name is Lord Ciencia. I'm an Engineering student, majoring in Electrical & Electronic.
I love learning random things, bouldering, and eating good food!

## Takeaways About "Clean Code"

1.) Module, class, or function should serve one "general" purpose, not multiple things (SRP).  
2.) Don't repeat code when you don't need to (DRY).  
3.) Use imperative mood for function names and function docstrings!
