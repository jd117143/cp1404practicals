# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?

100%

## What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?

Sunday/Monday nights, at home, ~3-4 hours (tends to go over)

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

Watching the videos and referring to the style guide

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

Being more efficient. I think my time management for this subject is still quite poor, so I want to allocate a more rigid timeframe both for watching the videos and finalising the practicals.

## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?

I don't think I utilise the Programming Patterns resource enough, apart from the style guide.

## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?

Taking my time with the exercises and giving them a fair go before looking at the solutions
