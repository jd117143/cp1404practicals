# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

My estimate accuracy was reasonable for the most part. I usually underestimated the time by ~1 hour.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

I believe it became more accurate towards the end of the subject.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

Doing the estimates improved my planning for each activity, since I had to think ahead about what needed to be done and
roughly how long each part would take.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

I’ve learned that there is always something to improve - often things you don’t notice yourself without an outside
perspective.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

Reviewing others’ code helped me recognise the things I do well and the areas I still need to work on. It reinforced
good habits while making me more aware of the bad ones.

### Good Code Review 1

[Practical 6](https://github.com/ConnorMcGhie/cp1404practicals/pull/2)

### Explanation

I was happy with the range of feedback I gave (both positive and constructive). I reviewed every file in the PR, and I
think the comments were meaningful because each one focused on a different aspect of the practical.

### Good Code Review 2

[Practical 7](https://github.com/Jamie7479/cp1404practicals/pull/3)

### Explanation

For this review, I think I did especially well identifying missing details, suggesting improvements to program structure
(such as placement of imports and functions), and recommending clearer naming of variables and functions.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

The practical lengths vary considerably, so I would consider adjusting the due dates based on workload. This might make
things more confusing for some students to track, but personally I think it would better reflect the effort required.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

I consistently read the practical instructions carefully and made sure my code worked as intended.
