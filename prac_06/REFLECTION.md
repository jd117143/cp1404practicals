# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

I've started following a more structured timeframe for watching the videos and completing the practicals.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

I still need to use the ProgrammingPatterns resource more consistently to make it part of my regular workflow.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

Watching the videos before the seminar and attempting every challenge activity.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I take too many breaks! I need to cut out distractions (especially my phone) when I sit down to work on the practicals at home.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

I'm not sure how frequent these will be from now on, but having more exam-style practice questions during the seminars would be great.
